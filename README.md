# p3-project-match
Our application is a Dating App that uses Python and SQL. We match users based on if they want a quickie, a long term relationship, or if they want to go for drinks. After matching, the users who matched are sent an automated email, telling them who they matched with and their email address so they can reach out.

To use this application:
1) run pipenv install
2) run pipenv shell
3) run ipython run.py

After you create your profile, you can view all the users on our app or you can run the match function by selecting the third option(3) to go straight to who you matched with!
